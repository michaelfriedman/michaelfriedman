# Michael Friedman

I'm a software engineering consultant, focusing on fullstack serverless web applications. I've got a non-traditional background for an engineer, with ten years experience in business development and sales management.

⚛️ &nbsp; I do all things JavaScript, but spend most my time working with React.

📝 &nbsp; I write a [weekly newsletter](https://michaels.blog), where I share insights that I've picked up along the way. 

☁️ &nbsp; AWS Certified Developer Associate

🌱 &nbsp; Experienced Working with Greenfield Startups

👨‍🎓 &nbsp; Graduated from Galvanize's Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive in 2017

🍎 &nbsp; I enjoy mentoring and working with junior devs.
